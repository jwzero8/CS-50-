My first project for being a self-taught programmer. Very likely to apply for a Master's Degree in Computer Science. Let's see what's going on.

Updated on 2/19/2022, I think self-taught is doable as long as you have the perseverance. Prefer practicing what I learnt in the workplace. Not necessarily apply for a CS master's degree.
